// This file allows you to exclude or hide OPs or change their labels.
// The complete list of table names are Object, Sop, Particle, Pop,
// Chopnet, Chop, Driver, Shop, Cop2, CopNet, Vop, and VopNet.
//
// Examples:
//
// The following line excludes the geo and light objects. Operators that
// are excluded do not exist as far as Houdini is concerned. They cannot be
// created by any means, and cause errors when loading a hip file with that
// operator type:
// opexclude Object geo light
//
// The following line renames the Merge Sop to "Combine Inputs". This affects
// only the English description of the operator that appears in toolbars, not
// the internal name of the operator:
// oprename Sop merge "Combine Inputs"
//
// The following line aliases an object called "thing" to be a geo object.
// This is an alias of the internal operator name, and affects the opadd
// command and loading existing hip files. So loading a hip file with an
// operator type "thing" will create a "geo" object in its place:
// opalias Object geo thing
//
// The following command deprecates the given operator type with supplied
// reason and hides it from toolbars. Deprecation warnings will show up when
// the user loads the scene so that they can be made aware which ops they
// should no longer be using and which they have been replaced with (if any).
// opdeprecate -r "Use Voronoi tools instead" 11.0 Sop shatter
//
// The following line hides the generic shadow SHOP from the toolbars,
// but this SHOP can still be created using the opadd command, or loading
// in a hip file with this SHOP:
// ophide Shop gen_shadow

// In order to change the initial name of the op to something
// other than the internal name, the opfirstname command can
// be used.
